# Plot-Efficient-Frontier

The plot_eff_front function visualizes the efficient frontier in a mean-variance portfolio optimization context. It takes as input a range of expected returns (expretrange), a vector of expected returns (mu), standard deviations (sigma), a correlation matrix (rho), and optionally a risk-free rate (r_f). First, it constructs a covariance matrix Sig from the standard deviations and correlation coefficients. For each target expected return in expretrange, it computes the corresponding portfolio standard deviation using the optrisky function and stores the results in stdevrange. It then creates a scatter plot of the efficient frontier by plotting standard deviation against expected return, along with individual asset points (sigma, mu). If a risk-free rate is provided, the function additionally plots the Capital Market Line (CML), which shows the optimal risk-return trade-off in the presence of a risk-free asset. The CML is computed using the Sharpe ratio derived from the expected excess returns and the inverse of the covariance matrix.
